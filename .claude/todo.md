# Todo

- Refactor project 03 (I2S loopback) to extract reusable modules (I2S clock generation, I2S receiver) into `rtl/` so they can be used by the final sound-to-FFT project

# Done
- Positional project arg with prefix matching in Makefile (e.g. `make build 04` matches `04_hdmi_graph`)
- Investigate and fix Waveshare 3.2inch HDMI display failing to switch on reliably
